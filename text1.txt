Hey PAFNites!

It was wonderful to see everyone at the Welcome Back event, and we hope you all had fun too. We will have plenty more family bonding events throughout the year. Although it may seem like these events will be too many for you to go to all of them, the purpose of them is simply for people to network and bond, inside and outside of their PAFN family.

With that said, our first fam bonding event will be Brunch + Boardgames, this coming Sunday 9/2 from 10AM-12PM in the Newcomb Hall MSC! There will be free food and boardgames for all! :D

We hope to see you there!

Best,
PAFN Exec
